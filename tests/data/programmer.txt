Ava was the programmer who treated bugs like riddles left by the universe for her to solve. She would sit at her desk with a cup of cooling coffee and a playlist of instrumental tracks, tracing the flow of data through functions and modules until the problem’s outline came into focus. When the tricky concurrency bug surfaced, she didn't panic—she methodically reproduced the conditions, wrote a small failing test, and stepped through the stack until the culprit revealed itself.

Her colleagues admired not only her technical skill but her patience; she explained complex fixes with simple analogies and left notes in the code like little signposts for future travelers. When the system finally passed all tests, she leaned back, a small, satisfied smile on her face, already curious about the next challenge.
