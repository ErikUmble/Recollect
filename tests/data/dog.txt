Milo was the kind of dog who noticed small things: a loose shoelace, the rhythm of rain on the porch, the way the old oak tree cast a perfect shadow for an afternoon nap. He followed his human on slow walks through the neighborhood, tail wagging like a metronome, and greeted every passerby with the warm confidence of a creature who believed the world was mostly good.

One summer evening, Milo chased a stray firefly into the garden and, distracted by its blink, discovered a hidden patch of clover where his human had once buried a time capsule. Proud of his find, he sat by it like a guardian, content to protect that small, secret treasure as if it were his very own.
