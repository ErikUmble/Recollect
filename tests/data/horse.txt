Belle loved the early mornings when the sky was still cool and the barn doors creaked open to invite her into the paddock. She moved with the calm assurance of long-breathed patience, ears swiveling to catch the whispers of the wind and the distant rumble of the fields waking up. Children who came to the stables learned to read her moods in the tilt of her head and the soft snort that meant, "I'm ready."

On a certain spring day, when the fence had been mended and the meadow bloomed with daisies, Belle surprised everyone by stepping lightly through a narrow gap to reach a foal in need. She nudged the young one gently, guiding it back to safety as if fulfilling an unspoken duty to protect the herd.
